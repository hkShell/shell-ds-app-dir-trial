This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


This is my first attempt to work with `shell-ds-react-framework` and `NextJs 13` App router ( which is what NextJs is going to support, going forward).

This repository shows the issue, I am facing when tyring to set up a boiler plate simple project.

Hoping that if we can get the setup working satisfactorily, then it may become a boiler plate project for futre use.
